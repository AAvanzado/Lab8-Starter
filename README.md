## How are graceful degradation and service workers related?
They are related because the idea behind graceful degradation is to create a system that can maintain functionality regardless of any faults that may occur. Service workers contribute towards graceful degradation because its job is to enable features such as offline access. If we were to consider the event that a user would not have access to the internet for instance, a service worker could come in and still help provide the functionality of the application regardless of the fault of having no internet.
